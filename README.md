Live demo: https://coffeelivery-prqt7d4xf-andrecampll.vercel.app

This project was made to approach and practice advanced React concepts like reducers, Context API, TailwindCSS, SSR and SSG with Next.js.

Furthermore, there's advanced React Hook that handles the integration with the Nominatim API in order to do the geolocalization feature.

Also, great GraphQL integration with Apollo Client, CodeGen and HygraphCMS to provide all necessary product related data.
