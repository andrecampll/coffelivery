# Outcomes 🚀

- This project was made to approach and practice advanced React concepts like reducers and Context API to handle the global state management.

- TailwindCSS that builds up the entire application styles.

- SSR and SSG with Next.js to increase performance by rendering pages on server side (SSR) and static content (SSG).

- There's an advanced React Hook that handles the integration with the Nominatim API in order to do the geolocalization feature.

- An awesome integration with React Hook Form that handles the forms state management.

- Great GraphQL integration with Apollo Client to fetch products with GraphQL and CodeGen to automatically generate GraphQL's types.

- Hygraph connection to provide all necessary product related data.
